⚠️ This Project is a Work in Progress! ⚠️

This project is a simple showcase of an HTML/CSS website structure.
It serves purely educational and training purposes.



Notes:

The design and concept are original and created by me.

The company icon is sourced from ChatGPT.

I created this project with occasional help from AI tools.

AI support was used only when I didn't know how to implement certain parts.
